## 📊 Feature Engineering

- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** – 20-day average to smooth volatility.
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** – 20-day exponentially weighted average.
- **Lag Features** – Previous 1, 2, and 3 day closing prices.
- **Target Variable** – Next day's close price for supervised learning.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** – Trend-following indicator.
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** – Momentum oscillator.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

| Model Type          | Description                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 📉 Linear Regression | Baseline model for trend prediction      |
| 🌲 Random Forest     | Tree-based ensemble for classification   |
| ⚡ XGBoost           | Gradient-boosted trees for regression    |
| 🔍 Signal Strategy   | Rule-based signal generation for trading |

---

## 🔁 Backtesting Strategy

A rule-based portfolio strategy was implemented:

- **Buy**: If price expected to go up > 1%
- **Sell**: If price expected to fall > 1%
- Portfolio is updated iteratively, tracking:
  - 📈 Portfolio Value Over Time  
  - 📊 Total Return  
  - 🧮 Sharpe Ratio

---

## 🔍 Random Year Price Prediction

- Predict closing prices for a **randomly selected year** using Linear Regression.
- Train on all previous years.
- Evaluate prediction accuracy visually.

### Example:

```python
target_year = 2022  # Random year from available data
```

Plots actual vs predicted close price with evaluation table.

## 📈 Visualizations

- Correlation Heatmaps
- RSI and MACD Charts
- Portfolio Growth Curve
- Actual vs Predicted Close Price (Line Charts)
- Bar & Pie Charts for distribution and frequency analysis

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualizations  
- `sklearn` – Machine learning models  
- `xgboost` – Boosted trees  
- `streamlit` – Interactive dashboard
